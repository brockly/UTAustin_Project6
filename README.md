# Support Ticket Categorization Using Natural Language Processing

## Overview
This repository contains the **Support Ticket Categorization** project developed as part of the Great Learning Natural Language Processing (NLP) program in collaboration with UT Austin. The project focuses on automatically classifying and prioritizing customer support tickets using NLP techniques.

## Context
Businesses face the ongoing challenge of efficiently categorizing and responding to customer support tickets. Automating ticket classification helps improve customer satisfaction by enabling faster response times and better resource allocation.

## Objective
- Develop an automated support ticket categorization system using NLP.
- Classify incoming support tickets accurately.
- Assign relevant tags to tickets based on content analysis.
- Generate initial automated responses to improve response efficiency.

## Analysis & Modeling Steps
- Data preprocessing and exploratory analysis
- Feature engineering (text cleaning, tokenization, vectorization)
- Building classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Neural Networks)
- Sentiment analysis and automated response generation
- Model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning

## Tools and Libraries
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Hugging Face Hub (`huggingface_hub`)
- llama-cpp-python
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone [repository_url]
```

2. Open and run the provided Jupyter notebook (.ipynb file) to replicate the analysis and modeling steps.

## Data
Obtain the dataset from the resources.
